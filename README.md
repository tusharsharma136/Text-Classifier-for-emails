# Text-Classifier-ML-Web-App
A website built using streamlit that classifies texts into various categories. 

If you are working, then you are bound to face the problem of reading all the emails that are
cluttered in your inbox. Some may be relevant and some may just try to loot you. 
Our aim will be to process the data, store it properly and apply different models to predict the
category of an email. You should also show testing results on some random email taken by you
which is not in the dataset and predict its result based on the models you have taken.
